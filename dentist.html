      <p>It is, of course, no closely guarded secret, that whenever one among us stumbles upon the fortune to be gifted with a fine stallion or mare in its prime, of healthy and dignified stature, a single urgent question descends upon our minds: namely: what of its teeth? We have all had occasion to learn, at one point or another in the ordinary course of our lives, that an exterior that bespeaks a blessing, could conceal a curse; and that no quantity of rippling muscle can redeem a rotten core within. Yet though we burn to consult the concrete matter that could forthwith dispel our doubts, we remain ever cognizant of our benefactor’s watchful eyes; and so we muster all our breeding to affect a premature gratitude, and refrain. Hence the adage, as wise as it is ancient: “Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.” If, some hours later, finally alone with the creature, we discover incontrovertible evidence, “straight from the horse’s mouth,” as it were, of gleaming, uncorrupted pearls, our subsequent joy can be so immense and so spirited as to provoke us to hop into the saddle and rush back to our benefactor’s side to deliver a second, artless thanks. Cherished readers, let the memory of that joy serve now as your bi-annual reminder to go to the dentist.
